# YOLOv5-Uultrasound_probe
Combining deep learning (YOLOv5) with ultrasonic robots for real-time detection of target organs

I used libtorch to load the YOLOv5 weights, so cmake was used to generate the C++ program.
You may refer https://www.freesion.com/article/272917092/ for details.

Also, in order for Libtorch to load the weights, it needs to be converted using export.py.
